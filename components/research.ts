      "Recent discoveries in geochemistry suggest that iron-rich meteorites preserved interactions with the atmosphere 2.7 billion years ago. Based on these reactions, it was most likely the fact that the atmosphere was rich in carbon dioxide during the Archean eon. This is when life started to first develop on the planet, in the form of single-celled organisms.",

    details:
      "In order to use the tools we have today, we had to start over 2 million years ago, when they were used for hunting, gathering and self defence. These primitive tools were most likely used to interact with their environment. For example, rocks may have been used to open nuts or bones, and sticks may have been used to dig. Over time, as humans evolved, their tools did as well.",

However the one that humans had to endure was the Great Ice Age, where glaciers formed on all continents, and Antarctica and Greenland were much thicker pieces of land. There were many fluctuations in the climate, and it wasn't until about 6000 years ago when the last few ice caps melted in Canada.",
