      "In March 2023, fragments of a meteorite that date back to an impact from 3.48 billion years ago in Australia. This discovery was presented at the 54th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Texas. They were able to determine this by using radioisotope dating to confirm that the fragments called spherules, consisting of iridium, nickel-chromium minerals and rare osmium isotopes line up with that date.",
